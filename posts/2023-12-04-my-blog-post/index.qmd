Welcome and thank you for taking the time to check my first blog post on this website. This page serves as draft only, I want to see what code and figures would look like in case I generate them from inside Quarto.

### A Box Plot

```{r,echo=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
boxplot(len ~ dose, data = ToothGrowth, frame = FALSE,
        border = c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9"))
```

### A Line Plot

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
x <- 1:10
y1 <- x*x
y2  <- 2*y1

# Create a first line
plot(x, y1, type = "b", frame = FALSE, pch = 19, 
     col = "red", xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
# Add a second line
lines(x, y2, pch = 18, col = "blue", type = "b", lty = 2)
# Add a legend to the plot
legend("topleft", legend=c("Line 1", "Line 2"),
       col=c("red", "blue"), lty = 1:2, cex=0.8)
```
