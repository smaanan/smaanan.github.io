My doctoral research concentrated on innovating effective algorithms for estimating directed and undirected graphs in multivariate time series. Additionally, I introduced a novel information-theoretic criterion specifically tailored for optimal performance with time series data. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I achieved distinction in both a Master’s degree in Statistics and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics."

As a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University’s Department of Computer Science, I developed a profound understanding of the intersections between statistics and computer science. Additionally, my role as an adjunct lecturer in probability at Mohammed V University in Rabat enhanced my pedagogical skills through teaching a diverse group of students.\nCurrently, I am a lecturer in biostatistics at the Higher Institute of Nursing and Health Technology in Al Hoceïma, Morocco. This position has strengthened my practical applications of statistical methods in health care and medicine, sparking my passion for the field."

    "text": "Biostatistics (Fall Semester)\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to statistical methodologies essential for research in health and life sciences. Students gain a strong foundation in both descriptive and inferential statistics, including techniques for data collection, sampling, estimation, and hypothesis testing. The course covers essential topics such as measures of central tendency and dispersion, correlation, contingency tables, and statistical indices. Practical sessions emphasize hands-on data analysis using statistical software such as SPSS and R, enabling students to apply statistical tools effectively in their final research projects. A significant focus is placed on developing critical thinking skills for interpreting results and making data-driven decisions in the health sector.\nBelow is an outline of the topics, content, and assignments for the course.

Key topics include descriptive and analytical epidemiology, disease surveillance, and health data collection methods. Students learn to calculate and interpret critical epidemiological and statistical indicators such as incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates. The course also covers essential statistical methods for analyzing health data, including measures of central tendency and statistical indices. Through practical case studies and guided projects, students gain experience in conducting health surveys, analyzing data, and presenting findings.

    "text": "Vector Autoregressive Model\nThe analysis of multivariate time series is crucial for modeling and forecasting interconnected time-dependent data. One of the most commonly used models in this field is the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model. The VAR model of order \\(p\\) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_t = \\mathbf{A}_1 \\mathbf{Y}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{A}_2 \\mathbf{Y}_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\mathbf{A}_p \\mathbf{Y}_{t-p} + \\mathbf{u}_t\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}_t\\) is a \\(k \\times 1\\) vector of time series variables.\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_i\\) are \\(k \\times k\\) coefficient matrices.\n\\(\\mathbf{u}_t\\) is a white noise vector with zero mean and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\nMy research focuses on enhancing the accuracy of conditional independence graph estimation for multivariate time series data. This involves developing robust methodologies to capture and visualize the dynamic interdependencies between multiple time series variables."

    "text": "Quantile Regression\nQuantile regression provides a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between variables than mean regression by modeling conditional quantiles.\nThe LAD regression estimates the median of the dependent variable by minimizing the sum of absolute residuals. Given data points \\((x_i, y_i)\\) for \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\), the LAD estimator solves:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{LAD}} = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - x_i \\beta|\n\\]\nI investigate the asymptotic properties of the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimator for linear models with polynomial regressors. My work aims to provide theoretical insights and practical improvements for modeling data with heterogeneous conditional quantiles and outliers."

One common model is the Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR).\nThe SAR model is given by:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\rho \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the dependent variable,\n\\(\\mathbf{W}\\) is a spatial weights matrix,\n\\(\\rho\\) is the spatial autoregressive parameter,\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) contains explanatory variables,\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) is the error term.\n\nMy research aims to improve the performance of information-theoretic criteria, such as AIC and BIC, in estimating spatial autoregressive models. I explore these improvements under various conditions to ensure accurate model selection and parameter estimation in spatial data analysis."
