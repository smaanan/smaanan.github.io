    "text": "Education\nI successfully earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Auckland on June 10, 2019. My doctoral research concentrated on innovating effective algorithms for estimating directed and undirected graphs in multivariate time series. Additionally, I introduced a novel information-theoretic criterion specifically tailored for optimal performance with time series data. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I achieved distinction in both a Master’s degree in Statistics and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics."

As a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University’s Department of Computer Science, I developed a profound understanding of the intersections between statistics and computer science. Additionally, my role as an adjunct lecturer in probability at Mohammed V University in Rabat enhanced my pedagogical skills through teaching a diverse group of students.\nCurrently, I am a lecturer in biostatistics at the Higher Institute of Nursing and Health Technology in Al Hoceïma, Morocco. This position has strengthened my practical applications of statistical methods in health care and medicine, sparking my passion for the field."

    "text": "Vector Autoregressive Model\nThe analysis of multivariate time series is crucial for modeling and forecasting interconnected time-dependent data. One of the most commonly used models in this field is the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model. The VAR model of order \\(p\\) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_t = \\mathbf{A}_1 \\mathbf{Y}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{A}_2 \\mathbf{Y}_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\mathbf{A}_p \\mathbf{Y}_{t-p} + \\mathbf{u}_t\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}_t\\) is a \\(k \\times 1\\) vector of time series variables.\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_i\\) are \\(k \\times k\\) coefficient matrices.\n\\(\\mathbf{u}_t\\) is a white noise vector with zero mean and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\).\n\nMy research focuses on enhancing the accuracy of conditional independence graph estimation for multivariate time series data. This involves developing robust methodologies to capture and visualize the dynamic interdependencies between multiple time series variables."

Given data points \\((x_i, y_i)\\) for \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\), the LAD estimator solves:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{LAD}} = \\arg\\min_{\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - x_i \\beta|\n\\]\nI investigate the asymptotic properties of the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimator for linear models with polynomial regressors. My work aims to provide theoretical insights and practical improvements for modeling data with heterogeneous conditional quantiles and outliers."

I explore these improvements under various conditions to ensure accurate model selection and parameter estimation in spatial data analysis."
